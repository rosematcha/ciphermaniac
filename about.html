      <h1>About</h1>
      
      <p>Howdy! I'm Reese, the developer of Ciphermaniac. Ciphermaniac is a Pokemon Trading Card Game analysis platform focused on per-card meta analysis. I made Ciphermaniac out of a desire to track specific cards, a feature which I didn't see on the other tools for TGCG meta analysis.</p>

      <p>Without these amazing resources, this project would not have been possible.</p>

      <p>For anyone curious about what powers our site, it's largely raw-dogged JavaScript. (This is a decision I regret; please use a framework!) The site is hosted on Cloudflare, and we use Firebase for our database needs.</p>

      <p>If you have additional features you'd like to see on this site, <a href="https://ciphermaniac.com/feedback">please shoot me a message on the feedback form</a> and I'll try and get back to you son as I can! Please note that I am working on this in my spare time, and not the most experienced developer, so be nice.</p>

      <p>Thanks for checking out my silly little site, and I hope it's useful to you! â™¥</p>
