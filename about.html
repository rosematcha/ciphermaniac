      <h1>About</h1>
      
      <p>Howdy! I'm Reese, the developer of Ciphermaniac. Ciphermaniac is a Pokémon TCG analysis tool focused on per-card meta analysis. I made Ciphermaniac out of a desire to track specific cards, a feature which I didn't see on the other popular tools.</p>

      <p>The work on this site is largely built on the incredible work of other members of the community, including:</p>
      
      <ul class="credits-list">
        <li>
          <strong><a href="https://limitlesstcg.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LimitlessTCG</a></strong> - 
          for being the source of the tournament data that powers our analysis
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong><a href="https://www.trainerhill.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TrainerHill</a></strong> - 
          for inspiration on the user interface design and layout
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong><a href="https://tcgcsv.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TCGCSV</a></strong> - 
          for providing pricing data integration
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Without these amazing resources, this project would not exist.</p>

      <p>If you have additional features you'd like to see on this site, <a href="https://ciphermaniac.com/feedback">please shoot me a message on the feedback form</a> and I'll try and get back to you soon as I can! Please note that I am working on this in my spare time, and software development is not my forté, so be nice.</p>
